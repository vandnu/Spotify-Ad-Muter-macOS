# turn-down-spotify-ad
Reported a gambling ad (that was very loud). Made me kind of prepared to turn down the volume in the end of a song. The ad was really loud. Got the idea of making it automatic for when i wanted to listen while not wanting to be interrupted so much by (the "anxiety" of) going to get scared of the sudden loud ad). This turns down the volume auto.
